# 🏠Real Estate Price Estimator
A machine learning project that predicts housing prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.  
The project applies regression techniques and includes an interactive Gradio interface for easy predictions.

# 🚀Features
- Predict house prices based on input features.
- Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal.
- Compares multiple regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge).
- Ridge Regression chosen as the best-performing model.
- Interactive interface built with Gradio (runs inside the notebook).

# 📊 Dataset
